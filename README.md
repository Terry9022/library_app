# library_app

Use the Python Flask framework and SQLlite to create a library application that is a simple user interface to perform queries. The database has a User Table, Book Table, Author Table, and Borrow Table.

I use SQL to construct the database schema, specifically SQLite since this is a simple application. The user interface will be built using Python and the Flask framework. Python will be used to execute SQL queries on the SQLite database and display the results to the user.
The overall technology stack is:
- Database: SQLite
- Backend: Python + Flask
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/Javascript generated by Flask
- ORM: SQLAlchemy (for executing SQL queries from Python)
